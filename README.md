# vscode-common

This module represents code from
https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/master/src/vs/base/common and
https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/master/src/vs/workbench/contrib/tasks/commons,
explanted into a separate module for use as a lighter runtime dependency than
vscode itself.
